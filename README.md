# SQL-Injection-Detection-via-RNN-autencoder-and-LSTM-classifier
This project explores deep learning techniques for detecting SQL injection attacks. We evaluate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and RNNs with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) for analyzing and classifying SQL queries. The model is trained and tested on the CICIDS2017 dataset.
